# Bubbles.js
Added a callback function called bubbleCallbackFn which is called whenever a user clicks on a 'bubble-pick' element. This is useful for scenarios where the action to be taken is not necessarily known or defined in the 'convo', like NLC tasks.

# 7-Rasa_demo.html
It demonstrates the integration of a famous NLC framework - RASA with chat-bubble. It also provides a usecase for bubbleCallbackFn.
To use this, a RASA server has to set up. The port and URL have to be edited in the html file. After the ice, the user can enter any text and the output will be delivered through RASA.

I think chat-bubble is a very powerful and easy tool to use. These changes will help demonstrate the versatility of the project. Thanks
