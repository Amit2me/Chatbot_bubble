### A super-simple, tiny script for creating chat bot interfaces

![Screenshot](screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

- Super-easy to use, even if you don't code much! Here's the [tutorial](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dmitrizzle/chat-bubble/blob/master/component/start-here/hello.html).
- Insanely small footprint, 1.03KB GZipped.
- No dependencies. Written with ES5, vanilla JavaScript.

This component comes with styles in CSS files. They are separated in to multiple files. You can turn them into styled components, SASS or whatever for your convenience. For now it's just vanilla CSS so that this tool can work anywhere, regardless of the environment.
